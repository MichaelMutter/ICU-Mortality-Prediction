## Project Overview
In this project, we explored clinical predictors of **mortality in Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patients** using real-world medical data from the **MIMIC-III** database.  
The analysis focused on two main clinical variables:
- The presence of **Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)**.
- **Potassium levels** throughout the ICU stay.

Our goal was to determine whether these factors are significantly associated with ICU mortality and could serve as early indicators for clinical decision-making.

## Key Steps:
- **Data Processing:** Merging multiple clinical tables (patients, admissions, diagnoses, lab results) and engineering new features such as potassium statistics (mean, median, first, last, max).
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Using visualizations (boxplots, histograms, density plots) to understand distributions and detect outliers.
- **Statistical Testing:** Performing Chi-square tests, Mann-Whitney U tests, and normality checks (Shapiro-Wilk test) to validate associations.
- **Findings:**  
  - **Higher maximum and last potassium levels** were significantly correlated with mortality.
  - **An upward trend in potassium levels** during ICU stay was strongly associated with higher death rates.
  - No statistically significant relationship was found between gender, ethnicity, or COPD diagnosis alone and mortality.
